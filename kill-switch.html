<p>Programmer, Game Designer, and Project Manager</p>
<h3 id="team">Team</h3>
<p>Joni Brooks, Eric Bau, Angel Regalado, Linus Fackler, Cade Miller.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>KillSwitch is a top-down multiplayer arcade shooter where your health is time. The only way to get it back is taking over other NPC's or your friends! Make sure you have a good weapon to defend yourself too. This game was designed to play with up to 7 other friends and does not support single player, that being said, you can join by yourself but it just won't be very exciting.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>This game was another for a week long <a href="https://itch.io/jam/sgda-fall-2021-jam">game jam hosted by SGDA</a> during the fall semester of 2021 and the theme for the jam was "Memento Mori" which translates to "remember you must die". The team consisted of some friends I had made in SGDA and other projects, and it was all done virtually. This was the first <em>in-person</em> game jam I had done so I really wanted to make a local multiplayer and the rest of my team agreed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The jam went well, but I felt like the game had a lot of potential that was not explored in the jam. I tried to get some of the team and bring on a few others to work on it after the jam, but after multiple weeks where I was the only person contributing, I decided to move onto other things. I had fixed a lot of bugs and cleaned up the code so maybe one day I will come back to this project.</p>
<h2 id="whaticontributed">What I contributed</h2>
<ul>
<li>Essentially all of the code, if I did not write it, I fixed it.</li>
<li>Gameplay concept and design</li>
<li>Project management</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="challengesfaced">Challenges faced</h2>
<ul>
<li>During the jam I was in the process of moving into my apartment.</li>
<li>Many members had school or work and could not contribute as much as they would have liked too.<ul>
<li>This led to having scope creep on myself as I thought I would be working with more people</li></ul></li>
<li>Having a solid local multiplayer system with a lobby</li>
<li>Creating a system to take over other players and NPCs, changing sprites and weapons during runtime and making fluid movement</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatilearned">What I Learned</h2>
<p>I gained lots of knowledge on how unity's Input system worked, Animation override controllers, scriptable objects, and much more. This was the first time I had <em>somewhat successfully</em> made a large complex system with lots of moving parts. It was extremely difficult to conceptualize and do in a week, and gave me more appreciation for software design, especially in C#/Unity.</p></div>

<h3 id="role">Role</h3>
<p>Programmer, Game Designer, and Project Lead</p>
<h3 id="team">Team</h3>
<p>Dylan T Moss, Jonica Brooks, Silvano Gallegos</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>We made Astrothree for a week long <a href="https://itch.io/jam/sgda-spring-jam">game jam hosted by SGDA</a> during the spring semester of 2021 with the theme: "Rule of Three". The team consisted of my roommate and two people that I had never met, and it was all done virtually. I was the only one with prior game development experience and ended up leading the team. Additionally, this was my first time working with an artist and another programmer.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>We ended up making a top down wave based survival-arcade game, where the player has 3 forms and each form is more or less effective against different enemy forms. It also takes advantage of a free high-score api to keep track of high-scores over the internet.</p>
<h2 id="whaticontributed">What I Contributed</h2>
<ul>
<li>Came up with the original idea for the game</li>
<li>Created player input controls</li>
<li>The high-score system implementation and scene</li>
<li>Implement unity's 2D light renderer and post processing (especially seen with bloom)</li>
<li>Created an emission map for the character sprite-sheet</li>
<li>Created the wave-based gameplay system</li>
<li>All sounds effects</li>
<li>Distributed tasks to other team members</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="challengesfaced">Challenges faced</h2>
<p>As stated before, I was the only who had previous experience, so delegating tasks and making sure things are being completed in a good order took more time than expected. My teammates did amazing and I also contributed a lot, but having school during the week and also people having jobs didn't allow us to get as much done as I would've hoped for. Since many of them have never used Unity or made a game before, trying to guide them also took some time. For example, the character animation for attacking has a very small attack range, which made implementing gameplay fairly difficult.</p>
<h2 id="whatilearned">What I Learned</h2>
<p>I learned how nice it was to have a competent team who's skills are diverse and how important it is to communicate with them to have a good product. I also learned a lot about unity, from 2D lights and graphics to how <em>not</em> to organize code in a unity project. Although we got it to work, going to look back at the code does not seem like a good time. In addition I learned more about Coroutines and many other aspects about C# in Unity.</p>
<h2 id="whatimmostproudof">What I'm Most Proud of</h2>
<p>Getting the bloom to work and also the online high-score system to work I think really impressed the judges to where we won a prize for "Best Technical". Additionally I think this is one of the best looking games in terms of graphics I have made.</p></div>
